  Function for calculating radial velocity.

  Parameters:

  rest: Quantity
  The wavelength at rest, preferably in Angstroms. Must have the same units as obs.

  obs: Quantity
  The observed wavelength in your data, preferably in Angstroms. Must have the same units as rest.

  Returns:

  vel: Quantity
  Radial velocity in km/s.
